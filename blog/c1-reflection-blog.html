    <h3>What's your take the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>
      -Their aim is to keep the course on the cutting edge of industry standards. </br>
      -The phase system run's on a 3 weeks cycle. Student's are reassessed at the end of these phase cycle's.</br>
      -The focus is more on the essential concepts and principles of the skills being studies. Mastery will be an ongoing process.</br>
      -Pair programming is used to teach the essential interpersonal skills required to both pass the DBC and function in the workplace.

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
      EDA might not be as structured and organized as I had hope. There may be some inherent risks to a course style like this, as the course lessons and material are perpetually in a state of 'work-in-progress'. However this style of 'continuous integrations'
      is probably the best solution to the rapidly developing tech industry. We will need to take a greater degree of responsibility for our learning in this type of environment and cannot assume that everything we need to know is taught in this course.
      Getting hired will be a repeating feed-back loop of; rejection, improvement, resubmission. It's best to get used to that mindset now.

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>I see it giving me the opportunity to develop my interpersonal skills in parallel with technical skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA Changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>Not really. The video; <cite><a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a></cite>, is 3 years old and gave me mostly a perspective on the dev boot camp experience. Perhaps I need to learn more about the EDA 'experience' to compare
      and contrast the two better.

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning enviroment?</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>

    <h4>Does it make you nervous?</h4>
      <p>Yes</p>
